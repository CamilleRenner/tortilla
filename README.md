`tortilla` is a python library for wrapping up all the nuts and bolts of image
classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in a single package.

Powered by [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/),
It has deep integrations with [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom)
which helps us have powerful visualisations to monitor the training, and also publish ready plots for training, evaluation and predictions.

As always, contributions welcome. :D

**NOTE** This is a work in progress :construction:, and will take a few more weeks before its production ready.
